        <p>"We recently purchased one of the original homes in Meadow Brook CC. Wes did the inspection and uncovered a crack in the basement wall. Turns out the previous owner did an A-1 repair and Wes confirmed. He also told us the hot water heater would not last 3 months. He was absolutely right but at least we knew that going in. He also had referred us to a great plumber...who we wound up calling for the repair. Wes did a great job.!"</p>

    	<p>"Great job by Wes Villhard. Recommended by our realtor. Found a couple of   problems that we were able to negotiate to have fixed before purchase.   The inspection was very thorough. Would recommend Wes and Housemaster to   any buyer.."</p>

    	<p>"Our company flips houses as a business. There is only one guy who does our inspections, Wes Villhard. On more than one occasion he has saved us 's in foundation repairs and water leaks. We trust Wes to give us the straight dope on every property we buy...or pass up!"</p>
